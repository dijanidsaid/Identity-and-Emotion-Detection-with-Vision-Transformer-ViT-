# Identity-and-Emotion-Detection-with-Vision-Transformer-ViT-
This project develops a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for facial analysis, focusing on detecting both gender and emotional expressions. The workflow includes image preprocessing, patch-based encoding, transformer blocks, and a classification head to achieve robust performance in identity and emotion recognition.
