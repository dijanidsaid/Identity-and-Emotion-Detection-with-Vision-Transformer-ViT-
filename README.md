# Identity-and-Emotion-Detection-with-Vision-Transformer-ViT

This project develops a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** model for facial analysis, focusing on detecting both **gender** and **emotional expressions**. The workflow includes image preprocessing, patch-based encoding, transformer blocks, and a classification head to achieve robust performance in identity and emotion recognition.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a deep learning pipeline capable of analyzing human faces to:  
1. Predict the **gender** of a person (male or female).  
2. Recognize **emotional expressions**, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutral.  

The ViT architecture includes:  
- **Patch extraction**: Images are split into fixed-size patches.  
- **Patch encoding**: Each patch is embedded with positional information.  
- **Transformer blocks**: Multi-head self-attention layers capture complex relationships between patches.  
- **Classification head**: Fully connected layers output predictions for gender and emotion classes.  

## Datasets Used

1. **CK+ (Cohn-Kanade dataset)** – for **emotion detection**  
2. **Male and Female Faces dataset** – for **gender classification**

Both datasets are preprocessed with resizing, normalization, and optional data augmentation.  

## Workflow

1. **Data preprocessing**  
   - Resize images to 48x48 pixels  
   - Convert images to grayscale or RGB  
   - Normalize and augment data  

2. **Model construction**  
   - Implement ViT architecture using TensorFlow/Keras  
   - Configure patch size, transformer layers, attention heads, and MLP head  

3. **Training and evaluation**  
   - Split datasets into training and testing sets (80/20)  
   - Compile model with Adam optimizer, using **sparse categorical crossentropy loss** for emotion detection and **binary crossentropy loss** for gender classification
   - Train and validate the model, evaluate using accuracy metrics  

4. **Results**  
   - High accuracy for both emotion and gender classification  
   - ViT’s patch-based attention improves recognition of subtle facial features  

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow 2.x / Keras  
- NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, OpenCV
